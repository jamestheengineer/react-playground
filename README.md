wildfire-tracker - This demo app loads Google Maps, reaches out to NASA to pull all current fire data across the world, and parses the data to display it on the map. You can also click icons to get basic info on the fire event from NASA. Pretty impressive for a 30 minute demo on YouTube. Traversy Media https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontX4zfVqK8&t=1478s
